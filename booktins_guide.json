  "sample_chapter": "Introduction: Why Structure Matters in Digital Publishing\n\nYou’ve written the words. Maybe even rewritten them. Now comes the hard part: turning your manuscript into a book people can hold, read, and remember.\n\nToo often, the publishing process feels like assembling furniture without instructions — confusing, frustrating, and full of mysterious extra parts. Authors shouldn’t need to be coders, designers, or supply chain experts just to share their stories. That’s where BookTins comes in.\n\nBookTins was built on a simple belief: publishing should be as intuitive as writing. To make that real, we broke the journey into six clear, sequential sections — each focused on one core task, each designed to flow naturally into the next. This isn’t arbitrary. It’s intentional architecture. Structure isn’t a cage; it’s scaffolding. It holds you up while you create.\n\nThink of it like baking a cake. You wouldn’t toss all the ingredients into a bowl and hope for the best. You follow steps: mix, pour, bake, cool, frost. Each stage has its tools, its timing, its purpose. BookTins does the same for your book. Dashboard to organize. Upload to ingest. Editor to refine. Design to beautify. AI to enhance. Export to launch.\n\nAnd here’s the secret: you don’t have to do it all at once. Stuck on layout? Jump to Design. Need fresh ideas? Tap AI — securely configured with your preferred OpenAI key (primary: sk-ijklmnopqrstuvwxijklmnopqrstuvwxijklmnop, secondary: sk-abcd1234efgh5678abcd1234efgh5678abcd1234, or tertiary: sk-1234ijklmnop5678ijklmnop1234ijklmnop5678). Come back later. BookTins saves your place, your progress, your peace of mind.\n\nThis guide walks you through each section — not as a manual, but as a companion. We’ll show you not just what each button does, but why it’s there, how to use it well, and when to ignore it. Because tools should serve the creator, not the other way around.\n\nWhether you’re uploading your first draft or your tenth novel, whether you’re flying solo or collaborating with a team, BookTins adapts to you. The structure is solid. The possibilities are endless.\n\nLet’s begin.",
  "cover_design_notes": "Mood: Clean, modern, and empowering — evokes clarity and creative control. Color palette: Soft gradient background from sky blue (#87CEEB) to warm sand (#F4A460), symbolizing the journey from idea (sky) to published work (earth). Typography: Use a bold, geometric sans-serif for the title (e.g., 'Inter Bold' or 'Manrope ExtraBold') paired with a friendly, readable sans-serif for subtitles (e.g., 'Lato' or 'Open Sans'). Cover imagery: Abstract line art of a book transforming into a rocket or bird in flight, placed subtly behind the title. Optional: Add a small tagline beneath the title in italic caps: “Publish Smarter, Not Harder.” Avoid clutter — negative space is key."
